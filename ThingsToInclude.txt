	----------ALKALI ENGINE----------
	Things the engine needs to have

this is outdated. Not the plan anymore!!!

*Engine functionality
    *update loop
    *module initialization
    *---l-o-g-g-i-n-g---
    *profiling (of the performance variety, cops are not invited to Alkali's development)

  *Graphics
    *OpenGL base
    *2d completely, no z coords
    *backend shader support should be robust and flexible at runtime, for modders
    *2d lighting system (ray-tracing* might be feasible *not really ray-tracing, but an approximation would work)

  *System stuff
    *file reading/writing
    *multi-threading
    *custom string class (for ease of use)
    *memory management
    *Unix support (only when windows works, refactoring will be a bitch though)
    *XML support (though I will kill myself before I let it really be used)
    
  *Input
    *full keyboard support (maybe not macro keys like on mine)
    *mouse support (including mouse 5 and co. buttons)
    *Controller support (modifiable so that people can add their own controllers to it)

  *Sound
    *OGG, MP3 support
    *Maybe Fmod support (if it's FOSS (it's not really but good enough))

  *Scene (or world/level stuff)
    *runtime map compilation(to avoid how much of a pain in the ass it is in source)
    *triggers
    *fog
    *static world objects (like HPL's StatObjs)
    *tileing system
    *should support isometric and sideways 2d camera angles
    *particles
    *text displayed in the world
    *save games
    *texture decals on top of things

  *Entities
    *animation
    *ai decision making
    *interaction
    *texture components (so characters can change cloths, etc.)

  *Gui
    *buttons!
    *sliders!
    *menu widgets!
    *messages!
    *Oh My!
    

  *Runtime script loading
	This isn't really in bullet points like the rest is, but I'd like if most game logic can be done at runtime,
	only so that modders don't need a PhD in x64 assembly to read and write their own code. Modding will make the 
	games more popular and engender a better community around the game, win win either way in my book. AngleScript is
	probably the way to go then, only because I have experiance with it.

  *Math
    *ray tracer (ouch)
    *no rotations other than reflection and mirroring (because euler and quaternions fail in the second dimension)    

  *Development Tools

  *Network (not at all priority, but would be fun, if very resource consuming)
	NOTE: If you're future me trying to add this for real, fork the engine so that you don't have to worry about releasing Alkali as FOSS once I'm done with the prior version.
	Because you know some freak can, and will inevitably try to spread malware on our cute little farm sim. 
	With that being said...
